<p>Welcome to <b>FormsForEducation</b>!</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
  After installing the Add-on into a Spreadsheet, you have to initialize the
  necessary configurations.
</p>
<h2>Initializing your spreadsheet</h2>
<p>
  This is done by opening the <code>Add-ons > FormsForEducation</code> menu then
  clicking <code>Initialize</code>.
</p>
<p>After doing this, you are ready to configure your Question Banks!</p>
<h2>Configuring your Question Banks</h2>
<p><b>Question Banks</b> are your Google Drive Folders that have multiple Forms with questions.</p>
<p>These are collections of questions about the same subject that will be randomly chosen for your students.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to have them with the same level of difficulty, to avoid situations where students can get easier or harder questions. If you want to have multiple levels of difficulty for the same subject, consider creating one Question Bank per level ("Math - Easy" and "Math - Hard").</p>
<p><b>There are some important things to consider when creating your question bank:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each Question Bank is a single Google Drive Folder</li>
  <li>Each question inside a Question Bank is a single Google Forms file</li>
  <li>All the Google Forms should have these settings:
    <ul>
      <li>Be quizzes with a Maximum score of 100.</li>
      <li>Have the option <b>Quiz Feedback</b> set to <b>Manual after Review</b></b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
