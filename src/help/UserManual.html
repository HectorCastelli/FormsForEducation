<h3>Resending an application email</h3>
<p>
  If a student doesn't receive an email and you want to resent that student's
  test to a different address, you have two options:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the <b>Resend Application</b> option on the menu;</li>
  <li>Manually send the email with the data from the Professor email</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For option 2, you can copy the section of the email relevant to the student
  and paste it into a new email.
