# FormsForEducation

![FormsForEducation](/formsforeducation.png)

A GSuite Add-on that leverages banks of Google Forms to create interesting and dynamic tests composed of multiple Forms.

By using Question Banks (Google Drive folder with multiple Forms) you can create custom test for each student, composed of random questions from your Question Banks.

This can be used to reduce occurrences of cheating, since each student will get a unique set of questions.
