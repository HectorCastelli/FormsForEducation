## Why are these permissions necessary

All of the permissions listed above are necessary for the extension to work correctly and execute all of the functionality listed on them.

## Who can see the data from my Forms

Only the users with Editor access to your forms. The Add-On will not access your data and/or send it to remote locations. All you data remains yours.

## Can I revoke these permissions

Yes! If you need to review the permissions you granted to the Add-on, you can do so by going to Google Account -> Third-party apps with account access -> [Manage third-party access](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=web).

There, you can change or revoke the permissions.
